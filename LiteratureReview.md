## Quantum Key Distribution
1. **Abstract:** This is a paper published at 2018 that mainly describes the several QKD protocols structure like BB84, B92, and BBM92 and its usages. At the beginning, this article defines background of each protocol along with visual elaboration. Then, they have done a simulation to examine which protocol above has the most reliable photon exchanging rate. In their simulation, they have compared three results while these three QKD protocols have been eavesdropped by a third party to check how many keys can be received and how many errors can occur during the transmission. \

2. **Abstract:** As we all known, One-Time-Pad is the most secure way to build communication between two network nodes, so the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is taking advantage from it to build a much safer network environment called QKDN. However, the key generating rate of current QKDN is in a low speed. As a result, some other studies have explored other conception, which is called Quantum Key Pool (QKP), to mitigate the inefficiency of key production by storing generated keys. To be honest, traditional QKP brings other problems to the QKDN. Likely, the security of QKD will decrease because of the QKP needs to store keys for a while, and the basic performance of QKDN will be harmed. In this case, the author has denoted a conception “Multi-Path Based Quasi-Real-Time QKD” to enhance the security of QKD along with great dynamic response services in QKDN. More specially, the Quasi-real-time QKD could keep the absolutely secure of the quantum key after it has been generated in a dedicated time period, so they proposed the Virtual QKP to store quantum keys in different virtual space which is corresponding to separate secret key path. \

## Quantum Intro
1. **Abstract:** This paper explains how Quantum mechanics was adapted to be used in Quantum Computing by Peter Shor in 1994. Shor’s Quantum algorithm is a polynomial time algorithm, used in factoring integers. After Shor’s Algorithm showed that Quantum algorithms derived from Quantum mechanics could be used in Quantum Computers. A race to see if more Quantum mechanics could be used to create an algorithm for Quantum Computer.Quantum Computing potential to far exceed current computational powers by Quantum parallelism. This paper shows the increase of space is needed to increase computational power, with Quantum Computing the increase of space is exponential increased because of parallelism. Quantum Mechanics such as photon Polarization, Bra/Ket Notation and State Spaces are discussed in this paper. The most common Quantum Algorithms and Quantum environments are discussed in this paper. If you need a Quantum Computing term or algorithm explained in a way that makes sense for Non-Physicists this is a good reference paper. \

2. **Abstract:** In Humble’s Consumer Application of Quantum Computing the demands of commerce for Quantum Computing are discussed. Quantum Computing can change the way the world does finance security and commerce. When Quantum Computing registers a value the superposition and entanglement principles create a conceptual difference in interpreting the value. This is principle is important in the probabilistic of quantum whichcreate certifiable randomness. Randomness in current computing looks random but is generate from a non-random source, in Quantum Computing it would be a true random source and the outcome would be true random. Random plays big role in gambling and key generation cybersecurity and true random could create a stronger security for gambling and cybersecurity by making it almost imposable to guess the answer.
Consumer Application of Quantum Computing is a good source for see where Quantum Computing can fit into the commercial world and help predict uses. Quantum computing is not a fast growing industry even though there is a lot of money in the research right now. This article show how important Quantum Computing can be to the commerce and what quality Quantum Computing has that current computing can not replicate. \

3. **Abstract:** In this paper by Albash and Lidar they talk about Adiabatic Quantum Algorithms which is an alternative to the Quantum Computing Circuit model. Quantum Computing uses the Hamiltonians model and the Adiabatic Quantum algorithms optimize the Hamiltonians. In the Hamiltonian of an operator is used to correspond to the full energy of a system.Quantum Adibatic Algorithm in a dedicated device will optimize the combinatorial optimization problem, this means the best solution is easier to calculate. The combinatorial optimization problem is solved by evolving adiabatically when in the ground state. Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) can be as powerful as a non-stoquastic Hamiltonians in the circuit model, “non-stoquastic AQC and all other models for universal quantum computation can simulate one another with at most polynomial resource overhead”(Albash, Lidar).The performance of Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms is influenced from the quantum phase transition of the system thermodynamic limit. This means that unlike Circuit Quantum Computer where the limit is how many gates it has the limit of AQC is the thermodynamic limit. \

4. **Abstract:** In this paper by Bauckhage et al, Adiabatic Quantum Computers are using in binary optimization problems. In this paper they use Lloyd’s procedure to create k-means clustering and using Adiabatic Quantum Computer using Ising model to solve the same clustering problem, Lloyd’s procedure is the most commonly used to solve clustering. In this paper Adiabatic Quantum Computing is shown to be a better at solving the binary clustering using the Ising model.  “At the end of the process, two basis states have noticeably higher amplitudes |ai | 2 than the others and are therefore more likely to be measured; these are  00111111 and  11000000 and they both induce the clustering shown in”(Bauckhage et al). This shows that the Didactic example of clustering using the Ising model is solved better with the Adiabatic Quantum binary clustering. \

5. **Abstract:** In Ying’s paper it talks about what Quantum Computing can do compared to standard Computing. A Quantum Algorithm was found that could find a single search query in a unsorted database in square root time of common computers. This Quantum algorithm could also do prime factorization. Querying a database and prime factorization is very lucrative to company’s and this generated an interest in Quantum Computing. As interest grew for Quantum computing so did interest grow for a Quantum Turing Machine, the first viable options was created by Deutsch in 1985. To make a A.I. Quantum Computer Quantum algorithms need to be written and Quantum Computer Architecture has to be created. Quantum programming to make changes and interact with the machine. All this infrastructure has to be created and most of it has. The issues is that Quantum Computingprocessing power is not capable yet to run these program to thoroughly test them. This paper expands on the potential applications of Quantum in AI \
