\
**Contribution:** In Quantum cryptography the negative rules of quantum mechanics are what keep Quantum cryptography secure.
\
**Rationale:** The negative rule “One cannot take a measurement without perturbing the system”(“Gisin et al) show that once encrypted the system cannot be enumerated or the system changes and the encrypted data is lost.

## Quantum Encryption
1. **Citation:** A. Amerimehr and M. H. Dehkordi, “Quantum Symmetric Cryptosystem Based on Algebraic Codes,” IEEE Communications Letters, vol. 22, no. 9, pp. 1746–1749, Sep. 2018, doi: 10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2844245. \
**Problem Statement:** A good encryption scheme must provide confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation. Many existing quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) schemes do not provide all of these attributes, or are subject to various attacks due to the public announcement of measurement bases. \
**Research Question(s):** Can a quantum encryption scheme be created which meets the goals of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication without the existing problems of public basis announcement, back and forth transmission of qubits, and susceptibility to photon splitting attacks? \
**Contribution:** The authors propose a quantum scheme for performing symmetric encryption without the use of a public channel, which provides confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. The scheme also allows for key reuse and does not require quantum error correction. The scheme does require the pre-sharing of an encryption key, though this could be accomplished with other QKD methods. \
**Rationale:** The paper uses a mathematical justification for its claims, as well as providing an analysis of the probability of successfully faking a message or eavesdropping. \
**Investigative Approach:** The authors present a theoretical approach to their encryption system along with a simple example of it being used. They do not provide an experimental implementation, but the scheme appears simple enough that it could be implemented without much difficulty. \
**Lessons Learned:** This study is one of a few that were located pertaining to quantum encryption. It appears to be a very important proposal, as the single protocol can provide all the attributes of a good encryption system without the need for multiple keys or separate protocols to provide integrity and authentication. \
**Implications for Practice:** Based on the paper it seems as though this scheme could be practical to implement and provide major benefits for its users. The major downside is that it requires the use of a key with length equal to the length of the message, though it is possible that this could be generated with a quantum-resistant stream cipher seeded by a shorter key exchanged through QKD. \
**Implications for Research:** This paper references a few other quantum encryption schemes which could guide further research, as well as showing that it is possible to combine confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation into one protocol, which is a significant finding for our purposes.

## Quantum Key Distribution
1. **Citation:** A. I. Nurhadi and N. R. Syambas, "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocols: A Survey," 2018 4th International Conference on Wireless and Telematics (ICWT), Nusa Dua, 2018, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/ICWT.2018.8527822.
\
**Problem Statement:** This is a paper published at 2018 that mainly describes the several QKD protocols structure like BB84, B92, and BBM92 and its usages
\
**Research Question(s):** At the beginning, this article defines background of each protocol along with visual elaboration.
\
**Contribution:** Then, they have done a simulation to examine which protocol above has the most reliable photon exchanging rate. In their simulation, they have compared three results while these three QKD protocols have been eavesdropped by a third party to check how many keys can be received and how many errors can occur during the transmission.
\
**Rationale:** The authors state that Shor’s algorithm poses a threat to current conventional cryptography and that QKD protocols have been proven to provide unconditional communication security.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The authors use quantum mechanical laws and quantum algorithms to generate Quantum Key Distribution Protocols.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The protocol was successfully modeled and analyzed, and found to have a unconditional degree of security in securing quantum communication.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This system could be implemented on a quantum computer to secure quantum communications.
\
**Implications for Research:** It would be worth investigating if the shared key can be transmitted with a high degree of non-repudiation.

2. **Citation:** X. Liu et al., "Multi-path based Quasi-real-time Quantum Key Distribution in Software Defined Quantum Key Distribution Networks (SD-QKDN)," 2019 18th International Conference on Optical Communications andNetworks (ICOCN), Huangshan, China, 2019, pp. 1-3, doi: 10.1109/ICOCN.2019.8934684.
\
**Problem Statement:** The current rate of key generating QKDN is a low speed. As a result, some other studies have explored other conception, which is called Quantum Key Pool (QKP), to mitigate the inefficiency of key production by storing generated keys.
\
**Research Question(s):** One-Time-Pad is the most secure way to build communication between two network nodes, so the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is taking advantage from it to build a much safer network environment called QKDN, but traditional QKP brings problems to the QKDN.
\
**Contribution:** The security of QKD will decrease because of the QKP needs to store keys for a while, and the basic performance of QKDN will be harmed.In this case, the author has denoted a conception “Multi-Path Based Quasi-Real-Time QKD” to enhance the security of QKD along with great dynamic response services in QKDN
\
**Rationale:** The paper uses extensive calculations to demonstrate the security of their method and also provide a comparison to a quantum public key technique.
\
**Investigative Approach:** In this paper the author has denoted a conception“Multi-Path Based Quasi-Real-Time QKD” to enhance the security of QKD along with great dynamic response services in QKDN.
\
**Lessons Learned:** More specially, the Quasi-real-time QKD could keep the absolutely secure of the quantum key after it has been generated in a dedicated time period, so they proposed the Virtual QKP to store quantum keys in different virtual space which is corresponding to separate secret key path
\
**Implications for Practice:** Multi-Path Based Quasi-Real-Time QKD to enhance the security of QKD.
\
**Implications for Research:** Quasi-Real-Time QKD can keep the quantum key absolutely secure for a predetermined time period.

Chen, "Study on StatisticalAnalysis Method of Decoy-state Quantum Key Distribution with Finite-length Data," 2020 IEEE 4th Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC), Chongqing, China, 2020, pp. 2435-2440, doi: 10.1109/ITNEC48623.2020.9084715.
\
**Problem Statement:** This paper has been published on 2020 IEEE ITNEC conference, and it discusses the 4 different statistical methods that can measure the performance of the decoy QKD scheme under finite-length data.What is a decoy QKD scheme?
\
**Research Question(s):** Since there still exists a gap between the current QKD system and ideal one, some scientists have conquered this problem by using decoy scheme to improve the security and performance of QKD transmission. However, in the decoy scheme, the pre-request is the data exchanges between two nodes are infinite.
\
**Contribution:** With the limited data exchanges rate of the real world QKD system, this scheme will lead to the statistical fluctuation, which could reduce the security of quantum key generation and transmission. Therefore, the article analyzes the security limit of decoy scheme under finite-length data by utilizing 4 statistical analysis methods.
\
**Rationale:** After experiment and comparison finished, they have concluded that Chernoff boundary is the best choice which can meet the practical QKD system to provide the best security under finite-length data.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The authors have done experiments and comparison with DeMoivre-Lapalace theorem, Chebyshev inequality, Chernoff boundary and Hoeffding boundary.
\
**Lessons Learned:** When data length and confidence levels change Chernoff boundary has the best stability.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This is a good start when trying to deal with statistical fluctuations in QKD finite data lengths.
\
**Implications for Research:** This could add stability to any quantum cryptography that deals with quantum key distribution.

Han, "Research on Plug-and-Play Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution," 2020International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC), Jeju Island, Korea (South), 2020, pp. 890-893, doi: 10.1109/ICTC49870.2020.9289265.
\
**Problem Statement:** The QKD transmission rate is limited by optical channel losses and long-distance communication.
\
**Research Question(s):** In this case, TF-QKD not only maintains the confidentiality of data, but also can be used on a relevantly longer distance communication. Nevertheless, constructing the mode matching systems to finish the first interference of two types of lasers is very difficult.
\
**Contribution:** In ideal TF-QKD, the secure key rate scale can be enlarged to almost twice, so it can be used for a long-distance transmission which is much longer than the traditional QKD. In this case, TF-QKD not only maintains the confidentiality of data, but also can be used on a relevantly longer distance communication.
\
**Rationale:** The paper uses calculations and experimentation to create a a plug-and-play TF-QKD scheme.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The author’s group has created a QKD protocol has created a plug-and-play TF-QKD scheme, using M. Lucamarini Twin-field QKD protocol.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The author’s group has come up with a plug-and-play TF-QKD scheme, which can make TF-QKD system achievable, to implement long distance quantum key in a high visibility.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This TF-QKD scheme could allow for easy to use long distance quantum key transmission with high visibility.
\
**Implications for Research:** This could allow for the use of plug-and-play elements to cut down on the need to create our own solution.

## Quantum Non-Repudiation
1. **Citation:** N. Hematpour, S. Ahadpour, and S. Behnia, “Presence of dynamics of quantum dots in the digital signature using DNA alphabet and chaotic S-box,” Multimed Tools Appl, Nov. 2020, doi: 10.1007/s11042-020-10059-5. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-10059-5. [Accessed: 07-Feb-2021]
\
**Problem Statement:** Digital signatures are an important aspect for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a message, and this study investigates the usage of quantum dots to provide digital signatures.
\
**Research Question(s):** Not explicitly stated, but the authors are attempting to provide an improved way of implementing digital signatures with security against repudiation and forgery, and with a high degree of entropy. This method provides a longer signature with fewer steps and more security than previous implementations.
\
**Contribution:** The authors develop a scheme which uses a dynamic map based on quantum dots, a permutation and substitution scheme similar to AES, and DNA coding to create a quantum digital signature with a high degree of security as long as the signature is of sufficient length. By sending a dynamic quantum system's control parameter and critical points as well as some initial point in phase space, two parties could implement these digital signatures using a quantum computer, but without requiring a quantum channel for transmission.
\
**Rationale:** The authors argue for the security of their system by analyzing the statistical likelihood of an attacker being able to forge the signature or repudiate a message and establish that it decreases exponentially as a function of message length, as well as conducting numerical analysis on their proposed S-box. The security of their dynamic system is based on Lyapunov exponents, which have been discussed in other reviewed works as well.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The authors provide a theoretical implementation of two different versions of this protocol with examples encoding a simple phrase, and compare their security.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The protocol was successfully modeled and analyzed, and found to have a high degree of security based on the mathematical operations used.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This system could be a viable candidate for implementation on a quantum computer on which operators are able to set control parameters and critical points, though might not be suitable for an implementation on a quantum simulator or cloud based quantum computer.
\
**Implications for Research:** It would be worth investigating if there are other encryption systems that can transmit classical values using a non-quantum channel but still obtain the same high level of security given by a quantum system.

2. **Citation:** M.-S. Kang, C.-H. Hong, J. Heo, J.-I. Lim, and H.-J. Yang, “Quantum Signature Scheme Using a Single Qubit Rotation Operator,” Int J Theor Phys, vol. 54, no. 2, pp. 614–629, Feb. 2015, doi: 10.1007/s10773-014-2254-y.
\
**Problem Statement:** Digital signatures are an important aspect for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a message, and this study investigates the signing of quantum messages using a single qubit and rotation operators.
\
**Research Question(s):** This paper investigates the usage of arbitrated quantum signatures (AQS) and attempts to improve on the security of previously used methods by introducing decoy photons to secure the communications channel.
\
**Contribution:** This source was surprising in that it showed that quantum signatures can be used for both classical and quantum messages. The ability to sign a message using only a single qubit and a trusted third party is valuable. They show that forgery is impossible with this technique, but perfect non-repudiation is not. However, they rebut several possible cases in which the signature could be repudiated.
\
**Rationale:** The paper uses extensive calculations to demonstrate the security of their method and also provide a comparison to a quantum public key technique.
\
**Investigative Approach:** This paper presents a theoretical implementation of a new AQS method as well as rigorous mathematical defense of its validity and security, which is appropriate in this case.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The signature scheme proposed by the authors works with only a single qubit and does not require the sharing of an entangled Bell state between two parties. They also show that the trusted third party in the signature scheme provides superior security to other similar schemes as it provides real time non-repudiation.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This signature scheme could be used for signing quantum messages, but it is not useful for signing classical messages. One interesting circuit introduced (to me at least) in this paper was the quantum swap test, which checks the equality of two qubits without measuring either of them.
\
**Implications for Research:** A major takeaway is that unconditionally secure quantum signatures for quantum messages are impossible. Another is that quantum one-way functions like those used in RSA are difficult to establish, though rotation operators are promising candidates and function in this manner under certain constraints.

3. **Citation:** Georgios M. Nikolopoulos, and Marc Fischlin. “Information-Theoretically Secure Data Origin Authentication with Quantum and Classical Resources.” Cryptography 4.4 (2020): 31–. Web.
\
**Problem Statement:** Classical cryptography achieves information-theorhetically secure message authentication via universal hash functions and requires secure key distribution where keys are at least twice as long as the tag. It may be possible that integrity, data origin authentication, and non-repudiation can be better achieved with quantum cryptographic methods.
\
**Research Question(s):** Do QMACs offer an advantage over classical methods for message authentication?
\
**Contribution:** The findings of this study may serve as a benchmark for future research in this area. It asserts that certain known QMAC schemes are inferior to their classical counterparts and, thus, further research should be focused on other sets of schemes.
\
**Rationale:** Simple comparisons between various characteristics of QMAC and MAC schemes, constrained by frameworks presented by the authors, form the conclusion for this study.
\
**Investigative Approach:** Researchers devise a general theoretical framework for unconditionally secure prepare-and-measure QMACs that follows closely with that by which they analyzed classical MACs.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The authors found that a broad class of symmetric prepare-and-measure QMACs, even under ideal conditions, do not perform better than their classical counterparts, which contradicts conjecture in previous work. Key length increases linearly, rather than logarithmically as in classical schemes with similar capabilities.
\
**Implications for Practice:** Practically, the results of this study suggest that classical MACs are still superior to QMACs for ensuring integrity, data origin authentication, and non-repudiation. To date, only highly-constrained models have found similar performance of QMACs compared to their classical counterparts.
\
**Implications for Research:** Research regarding whether QMACs offer advantages over classical MACs now has a base under this study's constraints. The authors acknowledge that further research may involve the use of physical uncloneable functions with quantum readout.

\
**Problem Statement:** While key distribution is a well-studied context on which to apply quantum cryptography, message authentication, the certification of message originator, and message integrity can also benefit from the use of quantum resources.
\
**Research Question(s):** How can binary classical messages be authenticated using quantum authentication mechanisms?
\
**Contribution:** The presented QMAC protocols were, at the time, the first to promise data origin authentication and integrity and may still be the only, under the provided constraints, to claim an advantage over classical Wegman-Carter authentication.
\
**Rationale:** The researchers performed security analysis of the presented protocols for attacks that they felt were most dire at the time: the no-message attack, and the message attack, which are akin to the impersonation and substitution attacks, respectively.
\
**Investigative Approach:** This study proposes a simple QMAC protocol, including necessary conditions for avoiding forgery, and analyzes its security against common attacks. The researchers acknowledge the "perfect" conditions under which this protocol is analyzed, and suggest that further analysis under non-perfect conditions is necessary.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The researchers identify a set of quantum authentication protocols that, using a single qubit as the authentication key, allow for the successful authentication of classical messages with probability of forgery less than one. This protocol also provides the possibility of key reuse, though not with guaranteed security.
\
**Implications for Practice:** The conditions under which these protocols were developed and analyzed do not translate well to real-world applications.
\
**Implications for Research:** As acknowledged by the authors, additional research into the security of these protocols under real-world conditions is needed. With further research, the constraints imposed on these protocols should be extended to allow for longer messages and optimal selection of the publicly-known unitary operation (UE).

2. **Abstract:** In Humble’s Consumer Application of Quantum Computing the demands of commerce for Quantum Computing are discussed. Quantum Computing can change the way the world does finance security and commerce. When Quantum Computing registers a value the superposition and entanglement principles create a conceptual difference in interpreting the value. This is principle is important in the probabilistic of quantum which create certifiable randomness. Randomness in current computing looks random but is generate from a non-random source, in Quantum Computing it would be a true random source and the outcome would be true random.

3. **Abstract:** In this paper by Albash and Lidar they talk about Adiabatic Quantum Algorithms which is an alternative to the Quantum Computing Circuit model. Quantum Computing uses the Hamiltonians model and the Adiabatic Quantum algorithms optimize the Hamiltonians. In the Hamiltonian of an operator is used to correspond to the full energy of a system.Quantum Adibatic Algorithm in a dedicated device will optimize the combinatorial optimization problem, this means the best solution is easier to calculate. The combinatorial optimization problem is solved by evolving adiabatically when in the ground state. Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) can be as powerful as a non-stochastic Hamiltonians in the circuit model, “non-stoquastic(sp) AQC and all other models for universal quantum computation can simulate one another with at most polynomial resource overhead”(Albash, Lidar).The performance of Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms is influenced from the quantum phase transition of the system thermodynamic limit. This means that unlike Circuit Quantum Computer where the limit is how many gates it has the limit of AQC is the thermodynamic limit. \

4. **Abstract:** In this paper by Bauckhage et al, Adiabatic Quantum Computers are using in binary optimization problems. In this paper they use Lloyd’s procedure to create k-means clustering and using Adiabatic Quantum Computer using Ising model to solve the same clustering problem, Lloyd’s procedure is the most commonly used to solve clustering. In this paper Adiabatic Quantum Computing is shown to be a better at solving the binary clustering using the Ising model.  “At the end of the process, two basis states have noticeably higher amplitudes |ai | 2 than the others and are therefore more likely to be measured; these are  00111111 and  11000000 and they both induce the clustering shown in”(Bauckhage et al). This shows that the Didactic example of clustering using the Ising model is solved better with the Adiabatic Quantum binary clustering. \

5. **Abstract:** In Ying’s paper it talks about what Quantum Computing can do compared to standard Computing. A Quantum Algorithm was found that could find a single search query in a unsorted database in square root time of common computers. This Quantum algorithm could also do prime factorization. Querying a database and prime factorization is very lucrative to company’s and this generated an interest in Quantum Computing. As interest grew for Quantum computing so did interest grow for a Quantum Turing Machine, the first viable options was created by Deutsch in 1985. To make a A.I. Quantum Computer Quantum algorithms need to be written and Quantum Computer Architecture has to be created. Quantum programming to make changes and interact with the machine. All this infrastructure has to be created and most of it has. The issues is that Quantum Computing processing power is not capable yet to run these program to thoroughly test them.

\
**Problem Statement:** Quantum fingerprinting and hashing methods have a short research history relative to their classical counterparts. The state of the art is continually evolving with respect to these protocols.
\
**Research Question(s):** What is the state of the art for quantum fingerprinting and hashing?
\
**Contribution:** The authors present a summary of today's most relevant advances in quantum fingerprinting and hashing.
\
**Rationale:** This study addresses its primary goal by reviewing historical and recent advances in quantum cryptography as it applies to fingerprinting and hashing. The authors frequently identify iterations of and improvements to previous work that have formed the current state of the art.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The authors review literature that describes recent efforts for the development of quantum fingerprinting and hashing schemes.
\
**Lessons Learned:** Improvements to quantum fingerprinting, the mapping of classical data to a quantum state that identifies the original data, have largely been based on (Buhrman et al., 2001) and can be efficiently applied in read-once quantum branching programs. Quantum hashing extends quantum fingerprinting and must satisfy the one-way and collision resistance properties.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This study doesn't directly make any practical implications, but shows that the development of quantum cryptographic protocols for fingerprinting, and particularly hashing, have applications in mechanisms to ensure integrity and message authentication of classical messages.
\
**Implications for Research:** This study is a synthesis of current efforts to develop and improve quantum fingerprinting and hashing schemes. It may serve as a base for further research in these areas.

\
**Problem Statement:** Using an amplitude amplification technique, quantum collision and multi-target preimage search algorithms can be improved to attack symmetric cryptography.
\
**Research Question(s):** Can existing collision and preimage search algorithms (quantum and classical) that require prohibitive amounts of resources be improved to realize the true capabilities of quantum adversaries?
\
**Contribution:** The new quantum algorithm for collision and multi-target preimage search improves attacks against hash functions, key recovery in multi-user settings, and collision attacks on block cipher operation modes. This algorithm may also be used as building blocks for more complex cryptanalysis.
\
**Rationale:** The presented algorithm improve the on the time complexity of existing algorithms while requiring less quantum memory. Comparisons between new and existing algorithms are made under several conditions concerning the availability of quantum memory, ultimately suggesting that the new algorithm is superior unless quantum memory becomes as cheap as classical memory and parallelization is hard.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The presented algorithm extends previous work and was aimed at achieving improvements in time complexity with small quantum memory. Comparison of complexity is made against existing classical and quantum algorithms under various conditions to assert the improved performance of the new algorithm.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The new algorithm achieved, at the time, what was thought to be the fastest solution over classic algorithms with linear quantum space. The ability to parallelize the algorithm further improves its performance over existing algorithms.
\
**Implications for Practice:** The findings make clear that even quantum adversaries with limited resources pose a threat to cryptosystems in several classical settings. Further, promises of post-quantum security should be made carefully.
\
**Implications for Research:** The findings contradict conjecture on the complexity of such algorithms and raise new questions about the design of quantum algorithms for collisions and preimage searching when availability of quantum memory is limited. A particular feature of the new collision algorithm (a chosen image prefix) limits its complexity improvements - could a further optimized algorithm not relying on this feature be developed?

Smith, “Cryptographic Algorithm Metrics,” in Proceedings of the 20th National Information Systems Security Conference, Baltimore, Maryland, United States, 1997 [Online]. Available: https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/conference-paper/1997/10/10/proceedings-of-the-20th-nissc-1997/documents/128.pdf \
**Problem Statement:** At the time of this paper's publication, no currently accepted metrics for the measurement and specification of cryptographic strength existed. \
**Research Question(s):** Can a standard objective framework for the measurement and specification of cryptographic algorithm strength be created? \
**Contribution:** While the authors did not produce a numeric and objective framework for the classification of cryptographic algorithms, they propose a subjective and qualitative scale which can still provide value, as well as providing insight into their classification and analysis process. \
**Rationale:** While the work is somewhat dated due to the selection of algorithms only including those that existed in 1997, the classification scheme is useful. The authors cite several problems with the study, including a limited numer of algorithms, limited depth of investigation, lack of exposure to comment and criticism, and a limited technical literature review. \
**Investigative Approach:** The work relies heavily on known characteristics of existing algorithms and the ways in which they might be compared. The paper focuses on civilian encryption algorithms meant for use in commercial products and operating in Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode only. It covers symmetric and asymmetric algorithms. \
**Lessons Learned:** Classifying a diverse set of algorithms quantitatively is very difficult, as they can have very different attributes, and a small difference can have massive security implications for one protocol and no impact on another. \
**Implications for Practice:** The proposed standard from this paper does not appear to have been widely adopted, though it may have inspired work done in other standards, such as the Federal Information Protection Standard (FIPS). \
**Implications for Research:** Despite the problems mentioned in the Rationale section, the approach presented in this paper serves as a useful starting point in the evaluation of quantum cryptographic protocols and provides a number of factors to consider.

**Problem Statement:** Since the discovery of quantum key distribution, many protocols have been developed. These protocols have not been compared in depth, however, especially with regards to simulation and implementation. \
**Research Question(s):** How do the various quantum key distribution protocols compare in theoretical aspects and when simulated? \
**Contribution:** This paper provides a simple quantitative comparison of 11 different QKD schemes across six different factors, as well as a simulated analysis of the BB84 and 2-dimensional KBM09 protocols. \
**Investigative Approach:** This paper takes more of a survey approach, as all of the properties of the various protocols are apparent from the original sources in which they are proposed. The experimental comparison is limited to only evaluating the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) reliability of two protocols. \
**Lessons Learned:** The authors provide a simulated verification of the predicted error rates for the two reviewed protocols. \
**Implications for Practice:** None are obvious from the paper beyond the verification of predicted error rates of the simulated protocols. \
**Implications for Research:** This paper provides useful guidance on the ways protocols can be compared both theoretically and experimentally, and will serve us well as we work on the classification of the quantum cryptography schemes that we are reviewing.
