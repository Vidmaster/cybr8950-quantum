## Quantum Key Distribution
1. **Abstract:** This is a paper published at 2018 that mainly describes the several QKD protocols structure like BB84, B92, and BBM92 and its usages. At the beginning, this article defines background of each protocol along with visual elaboration. Then, they have done a simulation to examine which protocol above has the most reliable photon exchanging rate. In their simulation, they have compared three results while these three QKD protocols have been eavesdropped by a third party to check how many keys can be received and how many errors can occur during the transmission. \

2. **Abstract:** As we all known, One-Time-Pad is the most secure way to build communication between two network nodes, so the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is taking advantage from it to build a much safer network environment called QKDN. However, the key generating rate of current QKDN is in a low speed. As a result, some other studies have explored other conception, which is called Quantum Key Pool (QKP), to mitigate the inefficiency of key production by storing generated keys. To be honest, traditional QKP brings other problems to the QKDN. Likely, the security of QKD will decrease because of the QKP needs to store keys for a while, and the basic performance of QKDN will be harmed. In this case, the author has denoted a conception “Multi-Path Based Quasi-Real-Time QKD” to enhance the security of QKD along with great dynamic response services in QKDN. More specially, the Quasi-real-time QKD could keep the absolutely secure of the quantum key after it has been generated in a dedicated time period, so they proposed the Virtual QKP to store quantum keys in different virtual space which is corresponding to separate secret key path.
