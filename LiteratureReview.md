## Quantum Key Distribution
1. **Abstract:** This is a paper published at 2018 that mainly describes the several QKD protocols structure like BB84, B92, and BBM92 and its usages. At the beginning, this article defines background of each protocol along with visual elaboration. Then, they have done a simulation to examine which protocol above has the most reliable photon exchanging rate. In their simulation, they have compared three results while these three QKD protocols have been eavesdropped by a third party to check how many keys can be received and how many errors can occur during the transmission. \

\
**Problem Statement:** Digital signatures are an important aspect for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a message, and this study investigates the usage of quantum dots to provide digital signatures.
\
**Research Question(s):** Not explicitly stated, but the authors are attempting to provide an improved way of implementing digital signatures with security against repudiation and forgery, and with a high degree of entropy.
\
**Contribution:** The authors develop a scheme which uses a dynamic map based on quantum dots, a permutation and substitution scheme similar to AES, and DNA coding to create a quantum digital signature with a high degree of security as long as the signature is of sufficient length. By sending a dynamic quantum system's control parameter and critical points as well as some initial point in phase space, two parties could implement these digital signatures using a quantum computer, but without requiring a quantum channel for transmission.
\
**Rationale:** The authors argue for the security of their system by analyzing the statistical likelihood of an attacker being able to forge the signature or repudiate a message and establish that it decreases exponentially as a function of message length, as well as conducting numerical analysis on their proposed S-box. The security of their dynamic system is based on Lyapunov exponents, which have been discussed in other reviewed works as well.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The authors provide a theoretical implementation of two different versions of this protocol with examples encoding a simple phrase, and compare their security.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The protocol was successfully modeled and analyzed, and found to have a high degree of security based on the mathematical operations used.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This system could be a viable candidate for implementation on a quantum computer on which operators are able to set control parameters and critical points, though might not be suitable for an implementation on a quantum simulator or cloud based quantum computer.
\
**Implications for Research:** It would be worth investigating if there are other encryption systems that can transmit classical values using a non-quantum channel but still obtain the same high level of security given by a quantum system.
