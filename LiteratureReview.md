\
**Problem Statement:** This is a paper published at 2018 that mainly describes the several QKD protocols structure like BB84, B92, and BBM92 and its usages
\
**Research Question(s):** At the beginning, this article defines background of each protocol along with visual elaboration. 
\
**Contribution:** Then, they have done a simulation to examine which protocolabove has the most reliable photon exchanging rate. In their simulation, theyhave compared three results while these three QKD protocols have been eavesdropped by a third party to check how many keys can be received and how many errors can occur during the transmission.
\
**Rationale:** The authors state that Shor’s algorithm poses a threat to current conventional cryptography and that QKD protocols have been provento provide unconditional communication security.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The authors use quantum mechanical laws and quantum algorithms to generate Quantum Key Distribution Protocols.
\

Liu et al., "Multi-path based Quasi-real-time Quantum Key Distribution in Software Defined Quantum Key Distribution Networks (SD-QKDN)," 2019 18th International Conference on Optical Communications andNetworks (ICOCN), Huangshan, China, 2019, pp. 1-3, doi: 10.1109/ICOCN.2019.8934684.
\
**Problem Statement:** The current rate of key generating QKDN is a low speed. As a result, some other studies have explored other conception, which is called Quantum Key Pool (QKP), to mitigate the inefficiency of key production by storing generated keys.
\
**Research Question(s):** One-Time-Pad is the most secure way to build communication between two network nodes, so the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is taking advantage from it to build a much safer network environment called QKDN, but traditional QKP brings problems to the QKDN.
\
**Contribution:** The security of QKD will decrease because of the QKP needs to store keys for a while, and the basic performance of QKDN will be harmed.In this case, the author has denoted a conception “Multi-Path Based Quasi-Real-Time QKD” to enhance the security of QKD along with great dynamic response services in QKDN
\
**Rationale:** The paper uses extensive calculations to demonstrate the security of their method and also provide a comparison to a quantum public key technique.
\
**Investigative Approach:** In this paper the author has denoted a conception“Multi-Path Based Quasi-Real-Time QKD” to enhance the security of QKD along with great dynamic response services in QKDN.
\
**Lessons Learned:** More specially, the Quasi-real-time QKD could keep the absolutely secure of the quantum key after it has been generated in a dedicated time period, so they proposed the Virtual QKP to store quantum keys in different virtual space which is corresponding to separate secret key path
\
**Implications for Practice:** Multi-Path Based Quasi-real-time QKD can have the absolute secure QKD.
\
**Implications for Research:** QKD can keep the quantum key absolutely secure for a predetermined time period.

Chen, "Study on StatisticalAnalysis Method of Decoy-state Quantum Key Distribution with Finite-length Data," 2020 IEEE 4th Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC), Chongqing, China, 2020, pp. 2435-2440, doi: 10.1109/ITNEC48623.2020.9084715.
\
**Problem Statement:** This paper has been published on 2020 IEEE ITNEC conference, and it discusses the 4 different statistical methods that can measure the performance of the decoy QKD scheme under finite-length data.What is a decoy QKD scheme?
\
**Research Question(s):** Since there still exists a gap between the current QKD system and ideal one, some scientists have conquered this problem by using decoy scheme to improve the security and performance of QKD transmission. However, in the decoy scheme, the pre-request is the data exchanges between two nodes are infinite.
\
**Contribution:** With the limited data exchanges rate of the real world QKD system, this scheme will lead to the statistical fluctuation, which could reduce the security of quantum key generation and transmission. Therefore, the article analyzes the security limit of decoy scheme under finite-length data by utilizing 4 statistical analysis methods.
\
**Rationale:** After experiment and comparison finished, they have concluded that Chernoff boundary is the best choice which can meet the practical QKD system to provide the best security under finite-length data.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The authors have done experiments and comparison with DeMoivre-Lapalace theorem, Chebyshev inequality, Chernoff boundary and Hoeffding boundary.
\
**Lessons Learned:** When data length and confidence levels change Chernoff boundary has the best stability.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This is a good start when trying to deal with statistical fluctuations in QKD finite data lengths.
\
**Implications for Research:** This could add stability to any quantum cryptography that deals with quantum key distribution.

Han, "Research on Plug-and-Play Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution," 2020International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC), Jeju Island, Korea (South), 2020, pp. 890-893, doi: 10.1109/ICTC49870.2020.9289265.
\
**Problem Statement:** The QKD transmission rate is limited by optical channel losses and long-distance communication.
\
**Research Question(s):** In this case, TF-QKD not only maintains the confidentiality of data, but also can be used on a relevantly longer distance communication. Nevertheless, constructing the mode matching systems to finish the first interference of two types of lasers is very difficult.
\
**Contribution:** In ideal TF-QKD, the secure key rate scale can be enlarged to almost twice, so it can be used for a long-distance transmission which is much longer than the traditional QKD. In this case, TF-QKD not only maintains the confidentiality of data, but also can be used on a relevantly longer distance communication.
\
**Rationale:** The paper uses calculations and experimentation to create a a plug-and-play TF-QKD scheme.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The author’s group has created a QKD protocol has created a plug-and-play TF-QKD scheme, using M. Lucamarini Twin-field QKD protocol.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The author’s group has come up with a plug-and-play TF-QKD scheme, which can make TF-QKD system achievable, to implement long distance quantum key in a high visibility.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This TF-QKD scheme could allow for easy to use long distance quantum key transmission with high visibility.
\
**Implications for Research:** This could allow for the use of plug-and-play elements to cut down on the need to create our own solution.

## Quantum Non-Repudiation

Behnia, “Presence of dynamics of quantum dots in the digital signature using DNA alphabet and chaotic S-box,” Multimed Tools Appl, Nov. 2020, doi: 10.1007/s11042-020-10059-5. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-10059-5. [Accessed: 07-Feb-2021]
\
**Problem Statement:** Digital signatures are an important aspect for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a message, and this study investigates the usage of quantum dots to provide digital signatures.
\
**Research Question(s):** Not explicitly stated, but the authors are attempting to provide an improved way of implementing digital signatures with security against repudiation and forgery, and with a high degree of entropy. This method provides a longer signature with fewer steps and more security than previous implementations.
\
**Contribution:** The authors develop a scheme which uses a dynamic map based on quantum dots, a permutation and substitution scheme similar to AES, and DNA coding to create a quantum digital signature with a high degree of security as long as the signature is of sufficient length. By sending a dynamic quantum system's control parameter and critical points as well as some initial point in phase space, two parties could implement these digital signatures using a quantum computer, but without requiring a quantum channel for transmission.
\
**Rationale:** The authors argue for the security of their system by analyzing the statistical likelihood of an attacker being able to forge the signature or repudiate a message and establish that it decreases exponentially as a function of message length, as well as conducting numerical analysis on their proposed S-box. The security of their dynamic system is based on Lyapunov exponents, which have been discussed in other reviewed works as well.
\
**Investigative Approach:** The authors provide a theoretical implementation of two different versions of this protocol with examples encoding a simple phrase, and compare their security.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The protocol was successfully modeled and analyzed, and found to have a high degree of security based on the mathematical operations used.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This system could be a viable candidate for implementation on a quantum computer on which operators are able to set control parameters and critical points, though might not be suitable for an implementation on a quantum simulator or cloud based quantum computer.
\
**Implications for Research:** It would be worth investigating if there are other encryption systems that can transmit classical values using a non-quantum channel but still obtain the same high level of security given by a quantum system.

\
**Problem Statement:** Digital signatures are an important aspect for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a message, and this study investigates the signing of quantum messages using a single qubit and rotation operators.
\
**Research Question(s):** This paper investigates the usage of arbitrated quantum signatures (AQS) and attempts to improve on the security of previously used methods by introducing decoy photons to secure the communications channel.
\
**Contribution:** This source was surprising in that it showed that quantum signatures can be used for both classical and quantum messages. The ability to sign a message using only a single qubit and a trusted third party is valuable. They show that forgery is impossible with this technique, but perfect non-repudiation is not. However, they rebut several possible cases in which the signature could be repudiated.
\
**Rationale:** The paper uses extensive calculations to demonstrate the security of their method and also provide a comparison to a quantum public key technique.
\
**Investigative Approach:** This paper presents a theoretical implementation of a new AQS method as well as rigorous mathematical defense of its validity and security, which is appropriate in this case.
\
**Lessons Learned:** The signature scheme proposed by the authors works with only a single qubit and does not require the sharing of an entangled Bell state between two parties. They also show that the trusted third party in the signature scheme provides superior security to other similar schemes as it provides real time non-repudiation.
\
**Implications for Practice:** This signature scheme could be used for signing quantum messages, but it is not useful for signing classical messages. One interesting circuit introduced (to me at least) in this paper was the quantum swap test, which checks the equality of two qubits without measuring either of them.
\
**Implications for Research:** A major takeaway is that unconditionally secure quantum signatures for quantum messages are impossible. Another is that quantum one-way functions like those used in RSA are difficult to establish, though rotation operators are promising candidates and function in this manner under certain constraints.
