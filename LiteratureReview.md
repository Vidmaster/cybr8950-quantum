## Quantum Key Distribution
1. **Abstract:** This is a paper published at 2018 that mainly describes the several QKD protocols structure like BB84, B92, and BBM92 and its usages. At the beginning, this article defines background of each protocol along with visual elaboration. Then, they have done a simulation to examine which protocol above has the most reliable photon exchanging rate. In their simulation, they have compared three results while these three QKD protocols have been eavesdropped by a third party to check how many keys can be received and how many errors can occur during the transmission. \
