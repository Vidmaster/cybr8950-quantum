## Due Date
March 19th by class time

**Submit a GitHub repo link to canvas**
**Add Dr. Hale as a collaborator on your GitHub Repo**

## Overview

- [Setup Environments](#environment-setup)
- [Project realization](#project-realization) 
- [Research Paper Outline](#research-paper-outline)
- [Visual understanding (aka diagrams)](#diagrams) 
- [Issue Tracking / Planning](#issue-tracking-and-planning)
- [Presentation](#presentation)

## Environment setup -  Establish needed tooling and work environments
Regardless of the type of project you are working on, you will need some work environments. You should determine tooling needs, document their usage/installation/configuration and include that information in your project repostiory.

### Submission materials
Include your setup instructions in your main repository-level README.md file. The instructions should provide a clear pathway to setting up and configuring needed tools to begin working on your project. For maker-based projects this might be software dependencies and coding libraries or establishing some build files (in something like Docker). For breaker-based projects it might be creating VMs or docker containers to containerize the target of investigations.

#### Grading Criteria
Your team will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (27-30) | Some Issues (16-26) | Does not meet expectations (0-15)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Documentation | Documentation is clear and concise, but provides sufficient detail to understand the basic setup details. | Some documentation exists, but it is piecemeal or not entirely clear. | Little or no setup/configuration documentation or it is very hard to follow.|
| Works as expected | Installation instructions work as expected and correctly setup needed tooling/environments.  | Some minor problems during setup, but instructions mostly work. | Many significant issues in instructions makes setup difficult or impossible. |

**Total 60 points.**

## Project realization - Clearly document your efforts towards achieving the project methodology.
 1. Identify tasks achieved from your backlog
 2. Document the product increments (an agile term for the things you produce) generated in this milestone
 3. Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together


The bulk of the project work is centered on realizing the methodology you defined in Milestone 1. Here, you should identify the tasks you have achieved, document the product or other intellectual/applied outcomes that have resulted from your efforts, and bind your tasks to the outcomes and documentation you have produced so far.
Be productive, work towards completing your process, and document what you do. Documentation towards project realization will come in the form an intermediate project report. Your project report should be placed on GitHub in the same repository you used for Milestone 1. Create a new markdown file that contains the following.

# Progress Report (03/19/2021)
## Overview
(insert brief overview of efforts made)

(Duplicated from Henry's writting) As implementation of quantum cryptography protocols is a major goal of our project, we also need to consider which quantum programming languages or frameworks should be used. 
To a large extent this selection may be guided by the protocols themselves, as the different languages we have examined are suited for some uses over others. D-Wave provides
annealing quantum computers, while IBM provides gate-based quantum computers, and Xanadu provides photonic quantum computers. Each of these has its own strengths and 
weaknesses, and requires a different programming language to operate. As we consider the implementation of protocols further, we are likely to discover that some are simply 
not possible for us to implement currently, and others require implementation on a specific type of quantum hardware.

## Outcomes
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?)

 (Duplicated from Henry's writting) We anticipate that we will be able to make a set of recommendations toward confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation based on the state of the art in quantum 
 cryptography, as well as demonstrating their usability where implementations are feasible. We believe this research will be valuable, as there are many possible approaches 
 being proposed for quantum cryptography, but very few broad surveys of all these diverse techniques. Through the enumeration, classification, and evaluation of various 
 protocols, we hope to guide both researchers looking to iterate on past work and practitioners looking for ways to begin implementing quantum cryptography.

also list them out like this:
* outcome 1: e.g. Twin-field Quasi-real-time Quantum Key Distribution system can be used to enhance both security and efficiency during the transmission. (tentative)
* outcome 2: e.g. Optimized Decoy-state Quantum Key Distribution can be used for long distance comminication with lower latency. (tentative)

| Documentation | Code artifacts and tasks are documented well. Documentation is clear and illustrative. | Some code is documented, but large portions are not. | Little or no documentation.|
| Demonstrable Outcomes | The outcomes are successfully demoed for Dr. Hale. The team addresses and handles questions well. | The demo partially works, but there are some significant issues. | Many significant issues with artifacts (e.g. code, documents, etc).|


**Total 120 points.**

## Research Paper Outline  - Draft your Research Paper
You should focus, as part of this milestone, on drafting an outline of your research paper. The emphasis of this process is to prepare an outline early enough in the semester to work with Dr. Hale to refine it into your eventual paper. Even though you may not know all of your results and findings yet, you should be able to draft the skeleton of the paper and start drafting sections of the paper such as your literature review and methodology.

### Submission materials
Submit a draft document containing your outline on canvas using the milestone 2 project assignment. The outline can be in any document format, but .docx is preferable. 

### Grading Criteria
Your outline will not be graded using a rubric, but it is expected to meet the following requirements. 

1. Contains a well-written 500 word or less abstract that previews the argument to be made in the paper.
1. Has defined section headings for each of the sections you expect to have in your paper
1. Has a bulleted list of talking points you expect to fall within each section
1. Section headings and bullets build a narrative flow that is compatibile with your main research argument.

**Total: 80 points**

## Diagrams - Encapsulate your efforts diagrammatically (For now, just using Lucidchart) 
In addition to the project documentation, you should produce a set of process or conceptual diagrams suited to your project. This could be a set of activity diagrams for penetration-testing oriented projects, it could be software architecture diagrams for development-oriented projects, or it could be a process/conceptual model for other projects.

For more information about different types of diagrams, see:

### Grading Criteria
You should produce diagrams relevant to your project. Diagrams will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (27-30) | Some Issues (16-26) | Does not meet expectations (0-15)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Relevant | The diagrams are useful for conveying project details. | There are some issues that prevent the diagrams from contributing to understanding | The diagrams are tangential or not present. |
| Descriptive | The diagrams clarify the interoperation or operation of a feature of interest. They provides descriptive clarity. | The diagrams provides limited descriptive clarity. | The diagrams do not help the viewer understand the project. |

**Total 60 points.**


## Issue Tracking and Planning  - Stay organized with approrpriate tracking of tasks
You should continue to document tasking related to your project following milestone 1. Use the issue tracker and/or Kanban board features in your GitHub repo to track your progress. I hope to see a sufficient number, specificity, and allocation of tasks to each person. 

### Graditing criteria
This category will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (16-20) | Some Issues (11-15) | Does not meet expectations (0-10)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage | Sufficient tasks commensurate with the duration of the milestone are defined. Each task is specific and relevant to the project. Forward progress is made on most tasks. | There are too few tasks and/or many tasks are not very specific or relevant to your project. | There are too few or no tasks. Most tasks are not specific or relevant to the project and/or there is little-to-no progress evident. |
| Allocation and status | Issues are all marked with a status tag or cards are placed in the appropriate column in the kanban. Each is in the backlog, finished and in the 'done' category, or allocated to someone for handling as part of the current sprint. | Some issues are marked up accordingly, but not all. | Many issues have not been appropriately updated. Status tags are clearly out of date or cards are not placed in appropriate columns. |


### Submission materials
This part of the milestone is strictly captured by your Kanban board and/our issue tracker. 

### Grading Criteria
**Total 40 points.**

## Presentation - Present your progress to the class
You will be expected to present your Milestone 2 achievements to the class following the deadline. It is important that you use this time to both inform your classmates of your activities and to practice for your final presentation. Things to be considered are 1) conveying a sense of interest and excitement about your project 2) cool product demos, and 3) interesting findings of conducting your projects.

### Submission Materials
Submit your slides to Dr. Hale by the presentation days. Submit them by posting and pinning them in your team slack channel and via canvas.

### Grading Criteria
You will be graded by a presentation rubric.
