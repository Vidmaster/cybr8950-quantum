We introduce quantum digital signature schemes based on Quantum Dots, where DNA coding is used to increase the intricacy of phase space. We attain the optimal security standard by constructing a deterministic dynamic system in a finite phase space with n points and by using symbolic dynamics. Also, given the chaotic Substitution box(S-box), a confusing step has been added for greater security. The introduced quantum dynamical map is used to create procedures to resistance again the common attacks in the digital signature such as non-repudiation, unforgeability, and transferability. Its security depends on the length of the signature, directly.},

The message owner injects a randomizing factor into the original message and then strips the blind factor from the quantum blind signature signed by the blind signer. The verifier can validate the quantum signature and announce it publicly. At last, the analytical results show that the proposed scheme satisfies all of the security requirements of the blind signature: blindness, unforgeability, non-repudiation, unlinkability, and traceability. Due to there being no use of quantum entanglement states, the total feasibility and practicability of the scheme are obviously better than the previous ones.},

Previously, a novel quantum digital signature for classical messages has been proposed and gave an experimental demonstration of distributing quantum digital signatures from one sender to two receivers. Some improvement versions were subsequently presented, which made it more feasible with present technology. These proposals for quantum digital signatures are basic building blocks which only deal with the problem of sending single bit messages while no-forging and non-repudiation are guaranteed. For a multi-bit message, it is only mentioned that the basic building blocks must be iterated, but the iteration of the basic building block still does not suffice to define the entire protocol. In this paper, we show that it is necessary to define the entire protocol because some attacks will arise if these building blocks are used in a naive way of iteration. Therefore, we give a way of defining an entire protocol to deal with the problem of sending multi-bit messages based on the basic building blocks and analyse its security.},

Moreover, incorporated with low-loss asymmetric Mach–Zehnder interferometers and a real-time polarization calibration technique, we have successfully achieved a higher signature rate, e.g., 0.98 bit/s at 103 km, and to date, a record-breaking, to the best of our knowledge, transmission distance of over 280-km installed fibers.

	abstract = {The cryptographic community has widely acknowledged that the emergence of large quantum computers will pose a threat to most current public-key cryptography. Primitives that rely on order-finding problems, such as factoring and computing Discrete Logarithms, can be broken by Shor’s algorithm ([49]).Symmetric primitives, at first sight, seem less impacted by the arrival of quantum computers: Grover’s algorithm [31] for searching in an unstructured database finds a marked element among {\textbackslash}(2{\textasciicircum}\{n\}{\textbackslash}) in time {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}(2{\textasciicircum}\{n / 2\}){\textbackslash}), providing a quadratic speedup compared to the classical exhaustive search, essentially optimal. Cryptographers then commonly consider that doubling the length of the keys used will be enough to maintain the same level of security.From similar techniques, quantum collision search is known to attain {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}(2{\textasciicircum}\{n / 3\}){\textbackslash}) query complexity [20], compared to the classical {\textbackslash}(O(2{\textasciicircum}\{n / 2\}){\textbackslash}). However this quantum speedup is illusory: the actual quantum computation performed is actually more expensive than in the classical algorithm.In this paper, we investigate quantum collision and multi-target preimage search and present a new algorithm, that uses the amplitude amplification technique. As such, it relies on the same principle as Grover’s search. Our algorithm is the first to propose a time complexity that improves upon {\textbackslash}(O(2{\textasciicircum}\{n/2\}){\textbackslash}), in a simple setting with a single processor. This time complexity is {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}(2{\textasciicircum}\{2n/5\}){\textbackslash}) (equal to its query complexity), with a polynomial quantum memory needed (O(n)), and a small classical memory complexity of {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}(2{\textasciicircum}\{n/5\}){\textbackslash}). For multi-target preimage attacks, these complexities become {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}(2{\textasciicircum}\{3n/7\}){\textbackslash}), O(n) and {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}(2{\textasciicircum}\{n/7\}){\textbackslash}) respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof of an actual quantum time speedup for collision search. We also propose a parallelization of these algorithms. This result has an impact on several symmetric cryptography scenarios: we detail how to improve upon previous attacks for hash function collisions and multi-target preimages, how to perform an improved key recovery in the multi-user setting, how to improve the collision attacks on operation modes, and point out that these improved algorithms can serve as basic tools for some families of cryptanalytic techniques.In the end, we discuss the implications of these new attacks on post-quantum security.},

In this paper we define and investigate the authentication of messages composed of quantum states. Assuming S and R have access to an insecure quantum channel and share a private, classical random key, we provide a non-interactive scheme that enables S both to encrypt and to authenticate (with unconditional security) an m qubit message by encoding it into m+s qubits, where the failure probability decreases exponentially in the security parameter s. The classical private key is 2m+O(s) bits. To achieve this, we give a highly efficient protocol for testing the purity of shared EPR pairs. We also show that any scheme to authenticate quantum messages must also encrypt them. (In contrast, one can authenticate a classical message while leaving it publicly readable.) This has two important consequences: On one hand, it allows us to give a lower bound of 2m key bits for authenticating m qubits, which makes our protocol asymptotically optimal. On the other hand, we use it to show that digitally signing quantum states is impossible, even with only computational security.},

It is found that the Kak’s protocol and its variants in their original form can be implemented only in a restricted class of noisy channels, where the protocols can be transformed to corresponding protocols based on logical qubits in decoherence free subspace. Specifically, it is observed that Kak’s protocol can be implemented in the presence of collective rotation and collective dephasing noise, but cannot be implemented in its original form in the presence of other types of noise, like amplitude and phase damping noise. Further, the performance of the protocol in the noisy environment is quantified by computing average fidelity under various noise models, and subsequently a set of preferred states for secure communication in noisy environment have also been identified.},

	abstract = {In this paper we analyze for the first time the post-quantum security of AES. AES is the most popular and widely used block cipher, established as the encryption standard by the NIST in 2001. We consider the secret key setting and, in particular, AES-256, the recommended primitive and one of the few existing ones that aims at providing a post-quantum security of 128 bits. In order to determine the new security margin, i.e., the lowest number of non-attacked rounds in time less than 2{\textasciicircum}128 encryptions, we first provide generalized and quantized versions of the best known cryptanalysis on reduced-round AES, as well as a discussion on attacks that don't seem to benefit from a significant quantum speed-up. We propose a new framework for structured search that encompasses both the classical and quantum attacks we present, and allows to efficiently compute their complexity. We believe this framework will be useful for future analysis. Our best attack is a quantum Demirci-Selçuk meet-in-the-middle attack. Unexpectedly , using the ideas underlying its design principle also enables us to obtain new, counter-intuitive classical TMD trade-offs. In particular, we can reduce the memory in some attacks against AES-256 and AES-128. One of the building blocks of our attacks is solving efficiently the AES S-Box differential equation, with respect to the quantum cost of a reversible S-Box. We believe that this generic quantum tool will be useful for future quantum differential attacks. Judging by the results obtained so far, AES seems a resistant primitive in the post-quantum world as well as in the classical one, with a bigger security margin with respect to quantum generic attacks.},

	abstract = {Introduced in 1996, NTRUEncrypt is not only one of the earliest but also one of the most scrutinized lattice-based cryptosystems and expected to remain secure in the upcoming era of quantum computing. Furthermore, NTRUEncrypt offers some efficiency benefits over “pre-quantum” cryptosystems like RSA or ECC since the low-level arithmetic operations are less computation-intensive and, thus, more suitable for constrained devices. In this paper, we present AVRNTRU, a highly-optimized implementation of NTRUEncrypt for 8-bit AVR microcontrollers that we developed from scratch to reach high performance and resistance to timing attacks. AVR NTRU complies with the EESS \#1 v3.1 specification and supports product-form parameter sets such as ees443ep1, ees587ep1, and ees743ep1. Entire encryption (including mask generation and blinding-polynomial generation) using the ees443ep1 parameters requires 847973 clock cycles on an ATmega1281 microcontroller; the decryption is more costly and has an execution time of 1051871 cycles. We achieved these results with the help of a novel hybrid technique for multiplication in a truncated polynomial ring, whereby one of the operands is a sparse ternary polynomial in product form and the other an arbitrary element of the ring. A constant-time multiplication in the ring given by the ees443ep1 parameters takes only 192577 cycles, which sets a new speed record for the arithmetic part of a lattice-based cryptosystem on AVR.},

	abstract = {Human dignity demands that personal information, like medical and forensic data, be hidden from the public. But veils of secrecy designed to preserve privacy may also be abused to cover up lies and deceit by parties entrusted with Data, unjustly harming citizens and eroding trust in central institutions.

Zero knowledge (ZK) proof systems are an ingenious cryptographic solution to the tension between the ideals of personal privacy and institutional integrity, enforcing the latter in a way that does not compromise the former. Public trust demands transparency from ZK systems, meaning they be set up with no reliance on any trusted party, and have no trapdoors that could be exploited by powerful parties to bear false witness. For ZK systems to be used with Big Data, it is imperative that the public verification process scale sublinearly in data size. Transparent ZK proofs that can be verified exponentially faster than data size were first described in the 1990s but early constructions were impractical, and no ZK system realized thus far in code (including that used by crypto-currencies like Zcash) has achieved both transparency and exponential verification speedup, simultaneously, for general computations.

Here we report the first realization of a transparent ZK system (ZK-STARK) in which verification scales exponentially faster than database size, and moreover, this exponential speedup in verification is observed concretely for meaningful and sequential computations, described next. Our system uses several recent advances on interactive oracle proofs (IOP), such as a “fast” (linear time) IOP system for error correcting codes.

Our proof-of-concept system allows the Police to prove to the public that the DNA profile of a Presidential Candidate does not appear in the forensic DNA profile database maintained by the Police. The proof, which is generated by the Police, relies on no external trusted party, and reveals no further information about the contents of the database, nor about the candidate’s profile; in particular, no DNA information is disclosed to any party outside the Police. The proof is shorter than the size of the DNA database, and verified faster than the time needed to examine that database naively.},

Our library is the first constant-time SIDH implementation and is up to 2.9 times faster than the previous best (non-constant-time) SIDH software. The high speeds in this paper are driven by compact, inversion-free point and isogeny arithmetic and fast SIDH-tailored field arithmetic: on an Intel Haswell processor, generating ephemeral public keys takes 46 million cycles for Alice and 52 million cycles for Bob, while computing the shared secret takes 44 million and 50 million cycles, respectively. The size of public keys is only 564 bytes, which is significantly smaller than most of the popular post-quantum key exchange alternatives. Ultimately, the size and speed of our software illustrates the strong potential of SIDH as a post-quantum key exchange candidate and we hope that these results encourage a wider cryptanalytic effort.},

However, the security of the resulting protocols depends on the selection of appropriate hash functions, and on the use of long authentication keys.

	abstract = {Richard Feynman's observation that quantum mechanical effects could not be simulated efficiently on a computer led to speculation that computation in general could be done more efficiently if it used quantum effects. This speculation appeared justified when Peter Shor described a polynomial time quantum algorithm for factoring integers. In quantum systems, the computational space increases exponentially with the size of the system which enables exponential parallelism. This parallelism could lead to exponentially faster quantum algorithms than possible classically. The catch is that accessing the results, which requires measurement, proves tricky and requires new non-traditional programming techniques. The aim of this paper is to guide computer scientists and other non-physicists through the conceptual and notational barriers that separate quantum computing from conventional computing. We introduce basic principles of quantum mechanics to explain where the power of quantum computers comes from and why it is difficult to harness. We describe quantum cryptography, teleportation, and dense coding. Various approaches to harnessing the power of quantum parallelism are explained, including Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, and Hogg's algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of quantum error correction.},

The application conditions of each method are discussed, and the effects of data length and confidence level on quantum key distribution security performance are simulated and analyzed. The simulation results show that the applicable conditions of Chernoff boundary are most consistent with the reality of the practical quantum key distribution system with finite-length data. Under the same experimental conditions, the secure key generation rate and secure transmission distance obtained by Chernoff boundary are better than those of the other three methods. When the data length and confidence level change, the stability of the security performance obtained by the Chernoff boundary is the best.},

This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study quantum computation from a complexity theoretic viewpoint. Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch's model of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97--117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension. We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that \$O({\textbackslash}log T)\$ bits of precision suffice to support a \$T\$ step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the Church--Turing thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class \${\textbackslash}BPP\$. The class \${\textbackslash}BQP\$ of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on a quantum Turing machine satisfies \${\textbackslash}BPP {\textbackslash}subseteq {\textbackslash}BQP {\textbackslash}subseteq {\textbackslash}Ptime{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}SP\}\$. Therefore, there is no possibility of giving a mathematical proof that quantum Turing machines are more powerful than classical probabilistic Turing machines (in the unrelativized setting) unless there is a major breakthrough in complexity theory.},
