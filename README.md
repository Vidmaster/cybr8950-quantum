# Quantum Communications and Cryptography
## Executive Summary
Quantum computers have the world on the brink of a second computing revolution. By using the unique properties of subatomic particles, they will be able to solve complex problems in minutes which would take a classical computer thousands of years. Foremost among these problems are many which are foundational to modern cryptography, such as the prime factorization problem at the core of internet security. While current quantum computers do not have the level of sophistication necessary to break today's encryption systems, it is only a matter of time before they gain that capability. We are undertaking this project to explore the implications of quantum computing on cryptography in order to stay ahead of this anticipated threat and preserve the security of sensitive communications as used for everything from internet browsing to military instructions.

What we are doing - identifying the best ways to send messages securely (C, I, NR) in the face of QC


## Project Goals
1. Evaluate the current state of quantum cryptography, including key distribution, encryption, and digital signatures
2. Evaluate the impacts of quantum computing on existing cryptographic protocols
3. Identify quantum and/or post-quantum protocols which provide confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation of messages
4. Provide a set of recommendations to STRATCOM's N3C regarding secure communications in a post-quantum world
5. Implement a proof of concept quantum key distribution protocol suitable for use with current encryption algorithms

## Project Merit
The merit of accomplishing the project goals and objectives in terms of how it helps end users, society, or particular industries/sectors/companies/agencies.
Why it is important - secure communications affect everything from privacy to nuclear launch instructions
