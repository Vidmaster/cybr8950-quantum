# Progress Report (March 20, 2021)
## Overview
Over the last several weeks, the team has continued our work on the research paper and completed a prototype implementation of the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution. We have been heavily focused on ensuring we have a comprehensive set of sources for use in our research, including representative samples of quantum cryptographic protocols that apply to confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.

## Outcomes
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?)

* Completed environment setup guide for OS X/Windows/*nix
* Completed sample BB84 implementation
* Initial work on outline
* Refined literature review and identified new sources

## Hinderances
Our team encountered several challenges during this period. We had several team members with significantly reduced availability due to professional obligations, which delayed our progress on the second milestone to some extent. We also encountered several major differences between operating systems when trying to configure our environments for prototyping, as Windows requires several undocumented dependencies to be installed in order for Anaconda and Jupyter Lab to work properly.

## Ongoing Risks
(address your project risks identified from Milestone 1 and update them based on your current progress, this should be a table)
|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Team Unavailability (73) | 8 | 9 | Members of the joint UNO and sponsor team are highly likely to become unavailable for planned and unplanned reasons during the course of this project. Type of impact will vary but, due to small team size, the magnitude of impact could be significant and will require increased coordination to mitigate. |
| Inexperience with Topic Domain (50) | 5 | 10 | As the team has already seen, the domain of this problem naturally presents issues in its density and breadth. Focused project scope and research discipline are necessary to avoid cycles wasted on work that does not contribute to the project goals. |
| Infrastructure and Technology Incompatibility (30) | 5 | 6 | The availability and capabilities of the infrastructure and technologies employed for our prototype deliverable could limit our ability to realize an ideal solution. Due in part to time contraints and available resources, the team may not identify the tools and technologies that are most likely to deliver optimal results. Enumerating available technologies, including their application and capabilites, will ensure that the team can pivot to appropriate alternates as necessary. |
| State of the Art Immaturity (25) | 5 | 5 | Because the goal to deliver a proof-of-concept that demonstrates real-world application of quantum schemes that ensure integrity, message authentication, and non-repudiation is highly dependent on the state of the art, any shortcomings of existing protocols will hinder the team's ability to realize a "complete" solution. As the team members are not experts in this field, and therefore unlikely to contribute truly novel solutions through research, it may need to consider re-scoping the requirements of its POC. |
| Ineffective Assessment (15) | 3 | 5 | Criteria by which the team's POC is assessed must be carefully selected and defined to ensure effective measurement of its performance and real-world viability. Criteria derived from existing studies may prove to be ineffective due to the scope or domain in which they were originally applied. The team should carefully consider criteria from a variety of existing studies - both quantum and classical - to ensure the capabilities of the POC are properly measured and accurately reported. |
