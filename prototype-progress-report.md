# Progress Report (March 21, 2021)
## Overview
Over the last several weeks, the team has continued our work on the research paper and completed a prototype implementation of the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution. We have been heavily focused on ensuring we have a comprehensive set of sources for use in our research, including representative samples of quantum cryptographic protocols that apply to confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.

## Outcomes
During this period, the team accomplished several fundamental steps toward the eventual realization of this project, including initial development environment setup for all team members, progress on the paper outline, and additional research on quantum cryptographic protocols.

* Completed environment setup guide for OS X/Windows/*nix
* Completed sample BB84 implementation
* Initial work on outline
* Refined literature review and identified new sources
* Defined classification criteria for algorithms

## Hinderances
Our team encountered several challenges during this period. We had several team members with significantly reduced availability due to professional obligations, which delayed our progress on the second milestone to some extent. We also encountered several major differences between operating systems when trying to configure our environments for prototyping, as Windows requires several undocumented dependencies to be installed in order for Anaconda and Jupyter Lab to work properly. We also found that while it was easy to follow a simple tutorial to implement BB84, it is significantly more challenging to translate a theoretical algorithm in a research paper into a practical implementation. As this is the core of our research project, however, this hinderance is to be expected and indicates that the problem is non-trivial.

## Ongoing Risks
(address your project risks identified from Milestone 1 and update them based on your current progress, this should be a table)
|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Updated Status |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Team Unavailability (73) | 8 | 9 | Team unavailability has had a medium impact on progress to date and continues to be a concern due to various professional obligations. |
| Inexperience with Topic Domain (32) | ~~5~~ 4 | ~~10~~ 8 | The team has managed this risk well and worked hard to increase our knowledge of the domain. While it remains a risk as we move into more advanced areas of the project, the impact and likelihood have been reduced. |
| Infrastructure and Technology Incompatibility (30) | 5 | 6 | No change in status. |
| State of the Art Immaturity (25) | 5 | ~~5~~ 3 | As the team has continued our research, we have found that a sufficient body of work exists to conduct meaningful research in this area. Due to our change in scope to focus on providing a template by which quantum cryptographic protocols can be implemented, we have reduced the likelihood of this risk affecting the project. |
| Ineffective Assessment (15) | 3 | 5 | The team has continued to take steps to mitigate this risk by brainstorming evaluation criteria and seeking evaluations of our proposals. |
