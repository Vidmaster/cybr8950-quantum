Technical plan thoughts:
Identify suitable QKD protocol
Explore languages for different implementation possibilities
Implement a trivial version of the protocol
Polish and refine with additional features:
  Customizable key length
  Eavesdropper detection



Real questions - which frameworks are we considering for implementation and why?
What metrics would we use for comparing one protocol to another?
How would we test or verify that a protocol is suitable based on our project goals?

Basically want to figure out what we're using and how to evaluate it on multiple fronts - algorithms, language/framework, etc.
